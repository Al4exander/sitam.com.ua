Правильно спроектированное, оно гарантирует электробезопасность бытовой техники и сохранения жизни при попадании молнии. Но для чего нужно заземление:\r\n- исключение появления высокого напряжения в грозу;\r\n- предупреждение опасных ситуаций, когда человек касается к электроустановки руками;\r\n- предотвращение замыканий и возгораний.\r\n\r\nДля правильной и безопасной работы системы необходимо изготовление проектной части и использование долговечных материалов.\r\n\r\nПредлагаем комплексное решение данного вопроса.\r\n\r\n1. Проектирование.\r\n2. Монтаж системы.\r\n3. Освидетельствование и замеры сертифицированной лабораторией.\r\n4.

Это комплекс специальных установок и технических решений. Но в целом схема установки молниезащиты состоит из схожих компонентов:\r\n\r\n- молниеотвода (второе название – громоотвод);\r\n- защитного контура;\r\n- заземления.\r\n\r\n##### Внешняя и внутренняя молниезащита\r\n\r\nМолниезащита бывает наружной и внутренней. Прежде всего, необходимо установить наружный громоотвод. Основной его элемент – один либо несколько приемников. Обычно они монтируются на крыше зданий. Основное назначение приемников – брать на себя удар молнии, не пропустить молнию к зданиям и сооружениям, а также прилегающему к ним участку. Выполняются они в виде мачт, тросов или стержней. Зона ионизации регулируется с учетом их параметров.\r\n\r\nПри разработке молниезащиты также учитываются параметры здания: место, ландшафт, пожароустойчивость.\r\n\r\nПри обустройстве молниезащиты и громоотвода важен правильный выбор материалов.\r\n\r\n`}};\r\n","export default
