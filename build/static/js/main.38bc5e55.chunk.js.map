Это комплекс специальных установок и технических решений. Но в целом схема установки молниезащиты состоит из схожих компонентов:\r\n\r\n- молниеотвода (второе название – громоотвод);\r\n- защитного контура;\r\n- заземления.\r\n\r\n##### Внешняя и внутренняя молниезащита\r\n\r\nМолниезащита бывает наружной и внутренней. Прежде всего, необходимо установить наружный громоотвод. Основной его элемент – один либо несколько приемников. Обычно они монтируются на крыше зданий. Основное назначение приемников – брать на себя удар молнии, не пропустить молнию к зданиям и сооружениям, а также прилегающему к ним участку. Выполняются они в виде мачт, тросов или стержней. Зона ионизации регулируется с учетом их параметров.\r\n\r\nПри разработке молниезащиты также учитываются параметры здания: место, ландшафт, пожароустойчивость.\r\n\r\nПри обустройстве молниезащиты и
