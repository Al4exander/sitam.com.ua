Правильно спроектированное, оно гарантирует электробезопасность бытовой техники и сохранения жизни при попадании молнии. Но для чего нужно заземление:\n- исключение появления высокого напряжения в грозу;\n- предупреждение опасных ситуаций, когда человек касается к электроустановки руками;\n- предотвращение замыканий и возгораний.\n\nДля правильной и безопасной работы системы необходимо изготовление проектной части и использование долговечных материалов.\n\nПредлагаем комплексное решение данного вопроса.\n\n1. Проектирование.\n2. Монтаж системы.\n3. Освидетельствование и замеры сертифицированной лабораторией.\n4.

Это комплекс специальных установок и технических решений. Но в целом схема установки молниезащиты состоит из схожих компонентов:\n\n- молниеотвода (второе название – громоотвод);\n- защитного контура;\n- заземления.\n\n##### Внешняя и внутренняя молниезащита\n\nМолниезащита бывает наружной и внутренней. Прежде всего, необходимо установить наружный громоотвод. Основной его элемент – один либо несколько приемников. Обычно они монтируются на крыше зданий. Основное назначение приемников – брать на себя удар молнии, не пропустить молнию к зданиям и сооружениям, а также прилегающему к ним участку. Выполняются они в виде мачт, тросов или стержней. Зона ионизации регулируется с учетом их параметров.\n\nПри разработке молниезащиты также учитываются параметры здания: место, ландшафт, пожароустойчивость.\n\nПри обустройстве молниезащиты и громоотвода важен правильный выбор материалов.\n\n`}};\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/2.6532f674.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/1.d69594ac.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/3.4d0b4d20.png\";","import firstImage from '../../images/pages/installation-of-granulators/2.png';\nimport secondImage from '../../images/pages/installation-of-granulators/1.png';\nimport thirdImage from '../../images/pages/installation-of-granulators/3.png';\nimport {PageTemplates} from \"../../pages/standartPages/enum\";\n\nexport const installationOfGranulators = {\n    url: '/installation-of-granulators',\n    type: PageTemplates.ThreeTwoImagesTwoTextsType,\n    title: 'Монтаж грануляторов',\n    firstImage,\n    secondImage,\n    thirdImage,\n    description: 'Демонтаж старого гранулятора и монтаж нового.
